## Projects

#### AR-You-Learning
* Acted as a demo lead on a group of four to build a native Android spelling game app by using AR (Sceneform) in **Java** that transforms a child's everyday scene into an immersive spelling playground. Download from Google [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capstone.aryoulearning).
* Integrated a tutorial screen that shows an instructional video at the beginning to guide a new user
* Configured a hint fragment with a RecyclerView and integrated the result count for each correctly-spelled word
* Collaborated with group members to learn ARCore in a two-week period with limited available documentation
* Participated in making a Github gist to save categories and images outside the app to reduce the app size and get them by making a Retrofit call when the game runs.
* Used Github to manage feature branches, resolve merge conflicts and contribute to the common codebase
#### BookSwappers
 * Managed an end-to-end development from design to deployment on a native Android app in **Java** that connects book lovers and allows users to exchange books rather than throwing them away. Coming to the Play Store soon.
* Implemented Google recommended single Activity, multiple Fragment structures and utilized listener pattern for inter-Fragment communication to ensure Java OOP encapsulation best practices
* Incorporated a NoSQL Firebase database in a fast-paced development cycle to ensure real-time data sync to users and to adapt well with rapidly changing data

#### TipCalculator
* A native Android app in **Kotlin** that calculates total bill amount with tips and then splits the bill based on a total person count
* Implemented Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture pattern to streamline code reuse and ease debugging
* Incorporated testing framework such as Mockito and JUnit to test both UI behaviors and calculating functions

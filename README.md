## Projects

#### [AR-You-Learning](https://github.com/KrishanRoy/AR-You-Learning)
* Acted as a demo lead on a group of four to build a native Android spelling game app by using AR (Sceneform) in **Java** that transforms a child's everyday scene into an immersive spelling playground. Download from Google [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capstone.aryoulearning).
* Integrated a tutorial screen that shows an instructional video at the beginning to guide a new user
* Configured a hint fragment with a RecyclerView and integrated the result count for each correctly-spelled word
* Collaborated with group members to learn ARCore in a two-week period with limited available documentation
* Participated in making a Github gist to save categories and images outside the app to reduce the app size and get them by making a Retrofit call when the game runs.
* Used Github to manage feature branches, resolve merge conflicts and contribute to the common codebase

#### [BookSwappers](https://github.com/KrishanRoy/BookSwappers)
 * Managed an end-to-end development from design to deployment on a native Android app in **Java** that connects book lovers and allows users to exchange books rather than throwing them away. Coming to the Play Store soon.
* Implemented Google recommended single Activity, multiple Fragment structures and utilized listener pattern for inter-Fragment communication to ensure Java OOP encapsulation best practices
* Incorporated a NoSQL Firebase database in a fast-paced development cycle to ensure real-time data sync to users and to adapt well with rapidly changing data

#### [TipCalculator](https://github.com/KrishanRoy/TipCalculator)
* A native Android app in **Kotlin** that calculates total bill amount with tips and then splits the bill based on a total person count
* Implemented Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture pattern to streamline code reuse and ease debugging
* Incorporated testing framework such as Mockito and JUnit to test both UI behaviors and calculating functions

*Part-Time Peer Remedial Math Tutor*
* Collaborate with professors to inform new students about the benefits of attending the tutoring and gather 5-10 “at-risk” students per session to attend voluntary tutoring that increases their math grades up to 33%
* Increase the attendance of first generation, international and low-income students through motivational speeches, regular emails, fliers, class visits, and report students’ progress to supervisors to improvise tutoring techniques
* Facilitate weekly API workshops to orient struggling math students to group discussions by delivering handouts, quizzes, and direct them to the Math Lab and other API tutors to ensure widespread support
* Provide personalized feedback to students by using positive reinforcement techniques and help them with time management and study habits skills to keep them coming to the tutoring and lead them to timely graduation
* Maintain the classroom environment safe through disciplinary standards to guarantee proper learning space
